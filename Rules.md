# Rules

## Objective

- The objective of the game is to win 2 out of 3 rounds (sub-games).
- To win a round, players must play a Unit card to the field. They then take turns playing Action cards
  on top of their Units to increase their Unit's stats.
- When both players consecutively pass their turn without playing an Action card, the round ends and the Player whose
  Unit has the highest stat among all stats wins that round.

- You can only play Actions on your own Unit.
    - There is a limit to the number of Actions you can play on your Unit (5? 7?). So that when you play an Action that
      hinders your opponent you also lose the opportunity of playing one that would benefit you.
- You can only play one card per turn.

- If your Unit is destroyed, you can play another one from your hand and keep playing.
  If you can't, you lose that Round.

## Card Types

### Action Cards

Action cards are played on top of Unit cards, and stay there until the end of the round, applying their effects.

You can only play regular Action cards on your own Unit.
